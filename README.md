<h1>Travel Journal</h1>

This is an HTML, CSS, project that was made available by Scrimba.  It challenges you to use external data and CSS in order to build out a list of travel destinations that you've visited in the past.  It also references the google maps link that takes you to the listed destination.

<h2>What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?</h2>

I'm most proud of the design.  The project didn't call for it to be responsive, but I wanted to get more familiar with making things fit onto mobile devices, so I took it upon myself to make sure that it could be seen on cell phones as well.

The thing that I would do differently is change my approach.  I know that I'm to design mobile-first, but I really didn't know HOW.  Once I figured out the 'column' approach to the mobile design was most beneficial, I hit my stride.

<h2>What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?</h2>

The one challenge that I'd say that I ran into was making the project responsive.  I just had to keep in mind that I just need to make things presentable, and not necessarily 'pixel perfect'.  This allowed me to use my margins and padding more effectively, and I allowed the containers that I worked within to expand and shrink as I see fit, rather than putting a static measurement on them.
